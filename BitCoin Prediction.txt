Business Requirements:

1)Volume :
   * Does volume determines the price
   * Is there a threshold for Vol. beyond which significant changes in the Price occur?

2)Opening Price:
   * How often does the Open price predict the High or Low of the day?
   * Is there a pattern where the Open price is closer to the High or the Low price during high-volume days?
   * Can the difference between Open and Price (closing price) be predicted using historical data?

3) High and Low Price Movements:
   * How often does the High price exceed the previous dayâ€™s Price by more than a certain percentage?
   * What is the typical difference between High and Low prices on days with significant Change % values?
   * Does a negative Change % correlate with lower volumes the next day?

4) Market Timing:
   * What is the average difference between Open and Price for days with unusually high Vol.?
   * Can significant changes in Change % be predicted by analyzing the relationship between Open, High, and Low prices?

5) Risk and Volatality
   * Does a larger range between High and Low indicate higher Change % on the same day?
   * Are periods of high Vol. more likely to lead to extreme daily ranges (High vs. Low)?

6)Market Momentum
   * Are there momentum trends where consecutive days of positive Change % lead to larger increases in Price over the week?
   * Does a series of low-volume days (Vol.) predict a sudden spike in trading activity and price movement?

7)Festive Season Trends:
   * How does Vol. (trading volume) change during festive months? Are there spikes in activity during these periods?
  * Is the Change % more volatile during the holiday season( November to January) due to increased or decreased market participation?
  * Are there correlations between increased consumer spending during festive seasons and a rise in cryptocurrency prices?
