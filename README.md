# Bitcoin-Market-Analysis-Predictive-Insights-for-Strategic-Decisions

## Overview ##
This intermediate-level project leverages historical Bitcoin market data (2010 to present) to develop a predictive model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and advanced business analysis techniques. The model achieves an impressive 94.14% prediction accuracy (MAPE: 5.86%), providing actionable insights for cryptocurrency investment strategies.

## Features ##
**Data Analysis:** Advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns in Bitcoin market data.

**Predictive Modeling:** Implemented an LSTM-based machine learning model to forecast Bitcoin prices and trading volumes.

**Actionable Insights:** Identification of key price thresholds and trading volume metrics to empower data-driven investment strategies.

**Visualization:** Interactive and clear visualizations to showcase trends, model predictions, and actionable insights.

## Technologies Used ##

**Programming Language:** Python

**Libraries/Frameworks:**

**Pandas, NumPy:** Data manipulation and analysis

**Matplotlib, Seaborn:** Data visualization

**TensorFlow/Keras:** LSTM model implementation

**Scikit-learn:** Performance evaluation
